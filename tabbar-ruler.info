1.1 Introduction
================

Tabbar ruler is an emacs package that allows both the tabbar and the
ruler to be used together. In addition it allows auto-hiding of the
menu-bar and tool-bar.

Tabbar appearance based on reverse engineering Aquaemacs code and
changing to my preferences, and Emacs Wiki.

Tabbar/Ruler integration is new. Tabbar should be active on mouse move.
Ruler should be active on self-insert commands.

Also allows auto-hiding of toolbar and menu.

To use this, put the library in your load path and use

(setq tabbar-ruler-global-tabbar 't) ; If you want tabbar (setq
tabbar-ruler-global-ruler 't) ; if you want a global ruler (setq
tabbar-ruler-popup-menu 't) ; If you want a popup menu. (setq
tabbar-ruler-popup-toolbar 't) ; If you want a popup toolbar

(require 'tabbar-ruler)

1.2 Known issues
================

the left arrow is text instead of an image. ## History

   * *10-Dec-2012* - Took out a statement that may fix the
     left-scrolling bug? (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *10-Dec-2012* - Added package-menu-mode to the excluded
     tabbar-ruler fight modes. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *07-Dec-2012* - Will no longer take over editing of org source
     blocks or info blocks. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *07-Dec-2012* - Changed the order of checking so that helm will
     work when you move a mouse. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *07-Dec-2012* - Now works with Helm. Should fix issue #1 (Matthew
     L. Fidler)

   * *06-Dec-2012* - Now colors are based on loaded theme (from
     minibar). Also added bug-fix for setting tabbar colors every time
     a frame opens. Also added a bug fix for right-clicking a frame
     that is not associated with a buffer. 1-Mar-2012 Matthew L. Fidler
     Last-Updated: Thu Mar 1 08:38:09 2012 (-0600) #656 (Matthew L.
     Fidler) Will not change tool-bar-mode in Mac. It causes some funny
     things to happen. 9-Feb-2012 Matthew L. Fidler Last-Updated: Thu
     Feb 9 19:18:21 2012 (-0600) #651 (Matthew L. Fidler) Will not
     change the menu bar in a Mac. Its always there. (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *14-Jan-2012* - Added more commands that trigger the ruler.
     (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *14-Jan-2012* - Added more ruler commands. It works a bit better
     now. Additionally I have changed the ep- to tabbar-ruler-.
     (Matthew L. Fidler)

   * *14-Jan-2012* - Changed EmacsPortable to tabbar-ruler (Matthew L.
     Fidler)

   * *08-Feb-2011* - Added ELPA tags. (Matthew L. Fidler)

     the last known mouse position. This fixes the two problems below.
     (us041375)

   * *20-Oct-2010* - As it turns out when the toolbar is hidden when
     the mouse is outside of the emacs window, it also hides when
